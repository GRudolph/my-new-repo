# Week 10

## Topic: Recursion

### Activities
- [ ] Review the slides on Recursion
- [ ] Review the example program on Recursion
- [ ] Read Chapter 10 in Big C++
- [ ] Complete Lab #10
- [ ] Complete project #6 and submit to Canvas before 11:59pm Sunday night (20% deduction per day late)

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, you should be able to:
- Explain the difference between iteration and recursion
- Recognize problems that lend themselves to being solved by recursion
- Design recursive solutions to computing problems
- Correctly write programs that use recursion
- Describe how the use of recursion affects the efficiency of a program

### Reading Assignment
1. Review the slides on recursion before you come to class this week
2. Read chapter 10 in Big C++

### Lab Assignment
Lab #10 provides some ideas on designing a recursive function, and gives you the opportunity to try these ideas out on a simple recursive problem.

### Project
This week you should complete project #6. This project will test your ability to design and create a more complex program that uses recursion.
