# Week 9

## Topic: Polymorphism

### Activities
- [ ] Review the slides on Polymorphism and read section 8.4 in Big C++
- [ ] Review the sample program on Polymorphism
- [ ] Complete Lab #9
- [ ] Complete project #5 and submit to Canvas before 11:59pm Sunday night (20% deduction per day late)

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, you should be able to:
- Explain the term *polymorphism*
- Design classes that correctly enable polymorphism
- Explain the terms *virtual method*, *pure virtual method* and *abstract class* and use these concepts correctly in a C++ program
- Correctly use polymorphism in a program
  - Store pointers to dynamically created objects in an array of base class pointers
- Use run time type identification in a program
- Learn how to downcast a pointer

### Reading Assignment
- Review the slides on Polymorphism before class
- Read section 8.4 in Big C++

> **Note:** Polymorphism is one of the most powerful capabilities of any object oriented language. Be sure that you know how it works.
