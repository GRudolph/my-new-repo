- Correctly declare and use a pointer variable
- Correctly initialize a pointer variable using the address-of operator
- Use the dereferencing operator correctly in a program
- Explain why pointers are typed
- Correctly use a pointer as a parameter in a function
- Explain what a void pointer is
- Explain the relationship between a pointer and an array
- Correctly use pointer arithmetic in a program
- Explain how the -> operator is used
- Describe the this pointer

### Reading Assignment
Before you come to class this week carefully review the slides on Pointers and read chapter 7 in Big C++.

### Important Concepts
1. Every variable in a C++ program is stored at some address in memory
2. A **Pointer** variable contains an address
3. Pointers are typed. When declaring a pointer we must declare the type of data we expect the pointer to point to
4. We use the **address-of** operator **&** to get the address of a variable
5. We use the **de-reference** operator **\*** to reference the variable that a pointer points to
6. Pointer variables should be set to the special value **NULL** when they do not contain a valid address
7. Every object implicitly contains a pointer whose name is **this**. The pointer contains the address of the object in memory
8. You can do arithmetic on pointers. When incrementing a pointer, you are adding one times the size of the variable being pointed to
9. Pointer arithmetic can be dangerous, as you may end up with an invalid address

### Lab Assignment
This week you should complete lab #6, where you will practice using pointers to manipulate characters in an array.

### Project
This week you should start work on Project #4. It will give you experience using pointers and dynamically allocated memory.
