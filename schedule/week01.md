# Week 1

## Topic: Introduction to C++

### Activities

- Review the slides on Introduction to C++ Part I
- Skim chapters 1, 2, 4 of PPP3
- Complete Lab #1
- Complete Project #1

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you should be able to:
- Write a simple C++ program that does console input and output
- Use the C++ string class in a program
- Use C++'s primitive data types in a program
- Use C++ control structures in a program
- Be able to explain the structure of a C++ program

### Reading Assignment

Skim through Chapters 1, 2, and 4 looking for similarities and differences with Python.

### Important Concepts
1. C++ uses a `#include` statement to include header files, similar to Python's `import`.
1. To use the standard input and output classes of C++ we must `#include <iostream>`.
1. C++ uses the statement `using namespace std;` to tell the compiler that the program will use the standard namespace. Everything in the C++ standard library is in the **standard** namespace.
5. The basic data types of C++ are very similar to those in Python.
6. The amount of storage used by C++ data types is not defined by the language. It is a function of how the underlying hardware works.
7. The control structures in C++ and Python work pretty much the same.
