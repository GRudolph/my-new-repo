### Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, you should be able to:
- Correctly write and use functions in C++ programs
- Demonstrate how to pass parameters by reference in C++
- Correctly write C++ programs that use arrays
- Correctly write C++ programs that use vectors
- Explain and correctly use the concept of "constantness" in C++

### Important Concepts
- Functions in C++ are the equivalent of methods in C#
- Functions work just like methods in C#
- The syntax for passing by reference in C++ is not the same as it is in C#
- In C++, arrays are not objects as they are in C#. As a result, arrays are declared differently from the way they are in C#
- In C++ it is easy to overflow the boundaries of an array and cause unexpected errors in your program. This is a key difference between C++ and C#
- C++ has a data structure called a **vector** that works much like an array in C#
