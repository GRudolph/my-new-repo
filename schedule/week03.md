### Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, you should be able to:
- Describe the object oriented model of programming
- Create a class diagram using UML
- Design, create and use classes in a C++ program
- Demonstrate that you can correctly structure a program in C++ that contains classes of your own design

### Reading Assignment
All reading should be done before you come to class. Your ability to understand the material discussed in class will be greatly enhanced when you come to class prepared. This week review the Slides on Object Oriented Programming in C++ and read chapter 5 in Big C++.

### Lab Assignment
This week you should complete lab #3. This lab provides instruction on writing classes in C++. You will practice this while writing a small program that contains a class that you have designed. Labs are not to be turned in. They are assigned to help you learn the concepts taught each week, and to practice using those concepts.

### Project
This week you will complete and submit project #2. In this project you will design, code, and test an Employee class. This class will be used as a starting point for several other projects this semester.
