# Week 8

## Topic: Inheritance

### Activities
- [ ] Review the slides on Inheritance and read sections 8.1 - 8.3 in Big C++
- [ ] Review the sample code on Inheritance
- [ ] Complete Lab #8 and submit to Canvas before 11:59pm Wednesday night
- [ ] Start work on project #5 (uses inheritance and polymorphism)

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, you should be able to:
- Explain the term Inheritance
- Demonstrate your ability to create a UML class diagram for a set of classes related by inheritance
- Demonstrate that you understand the terms base class and derived class
- Explain the difference between inheritance and composition
- Explain and correctly use the keyword *protected* in a program
- Demonstrate that you can design classes with strong cohesion and create programs where each class correctly manages its own data
- Write a constructor for a derived class that correctly calls the base class's constructor
- Describe the visibility of member data where inheritance is involved
- Explain how a derived class "hides" data and methods in the base class
- Describe the differences between upcasting and downcasting and know when to safely use each

### Reading Assignment
- Review the slides on Inheritance before coming to class
- Review sections 8.1 - 8.3 in Big C++

> **Note:** When using inheritance, be sure that each class manages its own data.

### Lab Assignment
Lab #8 will give you practice creating a class diagram that shows inheritance.

### Project
This week you should start on project #5. This project will develop your skills in writing programs that use inheritance and polymorphism. You will design and create two new classes that inherit from a base Employee class.
