# Week 4

## Topic: C++ File I/O

### Activities
- [ ] Review the slides on C++ Introduction Part III
- [ ] Read chapter 9 in Big C++
- [ ] Review the sample code on Persistence
- [ ] Complete Lab #4
- [ ] Start work on project #3 (due 2/8)

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, you should be able to:
- Write programs that can read data from a file
- Write programs that can write data to a file
- Correctly use the stream state to handle I/O errors and end-of-file conditions
- Create classes that are persistent

### Reading Assignment
All reading should be done before you come to class. Your ability to understand the material discussed in class will be greatly enhanced when you come to class prepared. Carefully review the slides on C++ File I/O and read chapter 9 in Big C++.

### Lab Assignment
This week you should complete lab #4. This lab explains how to do file I/O in C++. It will give you some practice in writing a small program that reads data from a file.

### Project
This week you start work on programming project #3. This project will further develop your skills in writing programs in C++ that do file I/O and use exceptions. This project adds the notion of persistence to your Employee class from project #2.
