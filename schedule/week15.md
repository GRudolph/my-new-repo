# Week 15

## Topic: Linked Lists

### Activities
- [ ] Review the slides on Linked Lists
- [ ] Complete your study of sections 12.1 and 12.2 in Big C++
- [ ] Review the video on Linked Lists
- [ ] Complete Lab #14 and submit to Canvas before 11:59pm Wednesday night
- [ ] Start work on project #9 (due next week)

### Learning Objectives
Studying linked lists exposes us to an important data structure that is used in countless computer science applications. In addition, linked lists make extensive use of pointers, and so provide additional practice using pointers in a C++ program. By the end of this unit, you should be able to:
- Describe the structure of a linked list
- Describe the operations that can be performed on a linked list
- Demonstrate that you can implement a linked list data structure in C++
- Explain the benefits of a linked list
- Point out the drawbacks of a linked list
- Use a linked list in a C++ program

### Reading Assignment
Review the slides on Linked Lists before you come to class this week. Read sections 12.1 and 12.2 in Big C++.

### Lab Assignment
Complete lab #14. This lab will get you started on the design for your Linked List program.

### Project
This week you will start work on project #9. This will be your final programming project, and it offers extra credit points, so you will want to get started early.
